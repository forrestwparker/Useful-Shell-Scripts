## DD-WRT

Scripts for use on routers running [DD-WRT](https://dd-wrt.com/). Note: The DD-WRT website is largely unmaintained. See the active community on the [DD-WRT Forums](https://forum.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/). These scripts have either been created by me or taken from [this page](https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Useful_Scripts) on the [DD-WRT wiki](https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).
