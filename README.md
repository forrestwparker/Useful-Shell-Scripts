# Useful Shell Scripts

This is a collection of shell scripts for various devices. These scripts were either taken from different sites online (referenced) or created by me. Until such a time that I discover otherwise, all scripts that I found elsewhere have been provided without any license. Any I create for this repository are likewise unlicensed and free for use.
